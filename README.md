# Disaster and Emergency Aid Management

## Project Overview
Disaster and Emergency Aid Management is a console application designed to efficiently manage the distribution of aid items during times of crisis. The application allows users to keep track of the quantity of each item needed, the number of items on hand, and facilitates the process of shipping items to affected areas.

## Use Case
When a disaster strikes a nation, the immediate priority is to provide affected people with essential supplies as quickly and efficiently as possible. The Disaster and Emergency Aid Management application addresses this need by:
- Managing a list of aid items needed for disaster relief efforts.
- Tracking the quantity of each item needed and the number of items on hand.
- Facilitating the process of shipping items to affected areas.
- Storing data in a file for future reference and analysis.

## Types of Items

The items needed for disaster relief efforts are divided into two main categories:

1. Non-Perishable Products:
- Examples: blankets, tents, clothing.
- These items have no expiry date and are referred to as "Items".

2. Perishable Products:
- Examples: food, medicine.
- These items have an expiry date and are referred to as "Perishables".

## Getting Started
To get started with the Disaster and Emergency Aid Management application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the C++ source code using your preferred compiler.
